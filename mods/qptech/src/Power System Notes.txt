(in volts)
Voltage - eg 16v etc
Amps - how many volt packets can be transferred
Capacitance - how many volt packets can be stored
MaxVoltage - if it goes too high then boom!
MaxAmps - how many packets can be transmitted at once
Connections - various power system things connected
Power Usage - 
Generator - Voltage Output, Amps out

Power packet - Voltage

Wire - has input, output face

OnTick:
- if a wire - offer packets to connections, reduce own amps accordingly (should fill up the network overtime)
- if a generator if it's on & running - offer a packet to connections

bool ReceivePacketOffer(int volts)- packet of energy offered to item - if it can recevie this packet return true,
and the calling entity will use it up, otherwise return false
- generators only offer packets
- wires offer and receive - will check against their amps (which is the number of packets they can hold)
- devices only receive packets

Ideas etc:
- breakers that will trip if too much voltage used
- have replaceable fuses
