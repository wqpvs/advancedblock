New 1.04 (Available Now!) fixed server crashes. 
New in 1.03 : Kitchen update!

Video

Kitchen cabinets - 3 part kitchen cabinets now available in all wood types. Act as containers (less slots than chests)
Icebox - a high food preservation block, put in a glacier ice block to get an extra bonus to food preservation (will very slowly use up ice) - only 5 slots for balance (with one to be taken up for ice if you chose)
Kitchen sink - decorative block available in all wood types, also functions as a liquid storage container
Large Cast Iron Oven - similar to the small one, but has a solid top and lines up with blocks. You can place items on top of it (for display only food items cook inside of it) Doesn't need a solid block below it.
Encased Lantern - a very bright, full block light source great for fitting into builds
Bronze Item Hatch - 24 slot storage chest to fit with the automated firepit
Automated Firepit - Automatically loads a firepit with items to process and fuel and outputs the items to a container. Saves you on fuel waste, and lets you load multiple different items, light it and come back later.

Bronze Machine Hull - intermediate, placeable item used to make the other parts
Firepit Loader - takes items from the container above it and pushes them into the firepit below it
Firepit Unloader - takes completed items from a firepit and pushes them into a container below it
Firepit Stoker - Takes fuel from a chest above it and pushes it to firepits on all four sides as needed. (Will only insert fuel one at a time and only if an item is being processed)
Bronze Industrial Oven - just a firepit with a fancy model and name (does not require the Machine Hull to build) gives a 10% heat bonus
